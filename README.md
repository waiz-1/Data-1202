# Walmart Retail Sales Analysis

## Project Description
This project analyzes Walmart retail sales data to gain insights into sales trends. The data is stored in a MySQL database and processed using Python libraries such as Pandas and Matplotlib. The project performs data extraction, transformation, and visualization to help understand key sales metrics.

## Getting Started
These instructions helps to set up the project on local machine for development and testing.

### Prerequisites
We need to install the following dependencies:
```sh
pip install pymysql
pip install pandas
pip install sqlalchemy
pip install matplotlib
```

### Installing
Follow these steps to set up the project:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your/project.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd project_directory
   ```
3. Install required Python packages:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Set up MySQL database connection using SQLAlchemy and PyMySQL.
5. Load the Walmart dataset (`WalmartRetailSalesF.csv`) into MySQL.

## Running the Tests
### End-to-End Tests
These tests ensure data is properly loaded and analyzed:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM sales_data;
```

### Coding Style Tests
To maintain code quality, run:
```sh
pylint your_script.py
```
